# JPAMB: Java Program Analysis Micro Benchmarks

The goal of this benchmark suite is to make a collection of interesting
micro-benchmarks to be solved by either dynamic or static analysis.

## Rules of the Game

The goal is to build a program analysis that takes a method ID as an argument, and 
returns a list of lines, each line consisting of a query and a prediction separated by semicolon `;`.
A method ID is the fully qualified name of the class, the method name, ":", and 
then the [method descriptor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se22/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3), 
for example:
```
jpamb.cases.Simple.assertPositive:(I)V
jpamb.cases.Simple.divideByZero:()I 
```

And the query is one of: 

| query              | description                               |
| :-----             | :-----                                    |
| `assertion error`  | an execution throws an assertion error    |
| `ok`               | an execution runs to completion           | 
| `*`                | an execution runs forever                 | 
| `divide by zero`   | an execution divides by zero              | 
| `out of bounds`    | an execution index an array out of bounds | 

And the prediction is either a wager (`-3`, `inf`) (the number of points you 
want to bet on you being right) or a probability (`30%`, `72%`)

Your analysis should look like this:

```shell
$> ./analysis "jpamb.cases.Simple.assertPositive:(I)V" 
divide by zero;5 
ok;25%
```

A wager is the number of points waged [`-inf`, `inf`] on your prediction. A negative wager is against the query, and 
a positive is for the query. A failed wager is subtracted from your points, however 
a successful wager is converted into points like so:
$$\mathtt{points} = 1 - \frac{1}{\mathtt{wager} + 1}$$

If you are sure that the method being analyzed does not contain an "assertion error", 
you can wager -200 points. If you are wrong, and the program does exhibit an assertion error, 
you lose 200 point, but if you are correct, you gain $1 - 1 / 201 = 0.995$ points.

Below are some example values. Note that small wagers equal smaller risk.

|  wager | points |
|   ---: |    ---:|
|   0.00 |   0.00 |
|   0.25 |   0.20 |
|   0.50 |   0.33 |
|   1.00 |   0.50 | 
|   3.00 |   0.75 | 
|   9.00 |   0.90 | 
|  99.00 |   0.99 | 
|    inf |   1.00 | 

Examples of such scripts can be seen in `solutions/`.

You can also respond with a probability [`0%`: `100%`], which is automatically converted into 
the optimal wager. An example of this is in `solutions/apriori.py`, which uses the distribution 
of errors from `stats/distribution.csv` to gain an advantage (which is cheating :D).

If you are curious, the optimal wager is found by solving the following quadratic function, where $p$ is the probability:
$$(1 - p) \cdot \mathtt{wager} = p \cdot \mathtt{points} = p \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{\mathtt{wager} + 1})$$
And dividing by 2 to get the optimal wager:
$$\mathtt{wager} = \frac{1 - 2 p }{2 (p - 1)}$$

|   prob |  wager |
|   ---: |    ---:|
|     0% |   -inf |
|    10% |     -8 |
|    25% |     -2 |
|    50% |      0 |
|    75% |      2 |
|    90% |      8 |
|   100% |    inf | 

## Evaluating

To get started evaluating your tool you can run the `bin/evaluate.py` script, it requires 
the `click` and `loguru` libraries and python 3.10 or above. You can install these dependencies using pip
in your favorite [environment](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/).

```shell
$> python -m venv .venv
# on unix systems
$> source .venv/bin/activate
# or on windows
PS> .venv\Scripts\activate
# now install stuff
$> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-treesitter.txt
```

Furthermore, to do good time reporting it uses a C compiler to compile the program `timer/sieve.c` and 
execute it alongside the analyses to calibrate the results.
Essentially, this computes a relative time (in relation to calculating the first 100,000 primes), as well as 
an absolute time. Make sure the environment variable `CC` is set to the name of your compiler, or 
that `gcc` is on your `PATH`.

First create a YAML file describing your experiment, see the `sample.yaml` file for an example.
And then to evaluate your analysis you should be able to run:
```shell
$> python bin/evaluate.py experiment.yaml > experiment.json
```

### Windows

The instructions above should also work for windows, but it is less straight forward.
The easy way out of this is to install Linux as a subsystem on your Windows machine. 
This is supported directly on [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
This will require you to do all of your development in this environment though.

If you prefer staying in Windows land, here are some tips and pointers:

-   Sometimes paths needs to be inverted in the examples `/` to `\`.

-   It is extra important to use [virtual environments](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/), 
    when using windows, that way you can keep different versions of python separate.

-   To support compiling with `gcc` and to make your life easier you 
    should install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with mingw-w64 GCC.
    You can do this by following the guide in the link above (step 6 - 9.).

### Debug

You can debug your code by running some of the methods or some of the tools, like this: 

```shell
$> ./evaluate your-experiment.yaml --filter-methods=Simple --filter-tools=syntaxer > experiment.json
```

Also, if you want more debug information you can add multiples `-vvv` to get more information.

### Source code

The source code is located under the `src/main/java`. 
A simple solution that analyze the source code directly using the [tree-sitter
library](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) is located at
`solutions/syntaxer.py`.

### Byte code

To write more advanced analysis it makes sense to make use of the byte-code. To
lower the bar to entrance, the byte code of the benchmarks have already been decompiled by the 
[`jvm2json`](https://github.com/kalhauge/jvm2json) tool. 
The codec for the output is described [here](https://github.com/kalhauge/jvm2json/blob/main/CODEC.txt).

Some sample code for how to get started can be seen in `solutions/bytecoder.py`.


## Developing

Before making a pull-request, please run `./bin/build.py` first.
The easiest way to do that is to run use the [nix tool](https://nixos.org/download/#download-nix) to download all dependencies. 

```shell
nix develop -c ./bin/build.py
```
